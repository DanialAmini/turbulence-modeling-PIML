# Data-driven Reynolds stress modeling with physics-informed machine learning

Jinlong Wu, Carlos Michelén-Ströfer, Jianxun Wang, Heng Xiao


A complex physical system characterized by a wide range of temporal and spatial scales, turbulence is among the last unsolved problems in classical physics that affects natural and engineered systems from sub-meter to planetary scales. Current simulations of turbulent flows rely on Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes equations with closure models.  In light of the decades-long stagnation in traditional turbulence modeling, we proposed data-driven, physics-informed machine learning method for turbulence modeling.

This repository contains tutorial Python scripts used to generated results published in the <<Wang2017Physics>> and <<Wu2018Physicsa>>. Also see: <<Wu2018Representation>>. Review relevant review articles: <<Duraisamy2019Turbulence>> and <<Xiao2019RANS>>

You can download the Jupyter Notebook to run and play with the code, or simply download the HTML version of the tutorial](regressionSolver.html) generated by the Jupyter Notebook.
